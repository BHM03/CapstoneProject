Hey, welcome to my project!

This is my current working version of my project that only has the ETL pipeline completed, so you'll only need to run the following command:
  (make sure you are in my etl directory first)
  python3 ingest.py artificial_transactions_100.csv

The results should be stored in the data -> warehouse directory under the name of transactions.csv
