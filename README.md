# Personal Finance Analyzer (ML + AI)

This project is a personal finance analyzer that allows users to upload bank or credit card CSV files, normalize and store transactions, train a machine learning model to automatically categorize spending, and see their finances through an interactive Streamlit dashboard. The system uses an ETL pipeline to standardize raw transaction data, a TF IDF and Logistic Regression classifier to predict categories for uncategorized transactions, and multiple analytics views including spending summaries, category breakdowns, simple forecasts, and subscription detection. An AI assistant page enables users to ask natural language questions about their finances using the currently filtered transaction data. The application is designed to be modular, transparent, and educational, demonstrating practical use of data preprocessing, supervised machine learning, and interactive data visualization in a real world personal finance context.
